# My Keyboard

I have a Kinesis Advantage2. I like it a lot

(I actually have two of them, at work and at home, so I need to sync between
them.)


## Keyboard Shortcuts

* Enable "PUM" (Power User Mode) (Program + Shift + Esc)
  * Only need to do this once
* Open "Kinesis KB" v-drive (Program + F1)
  * PUM is required
* Unmount v-drive (Program + F1)

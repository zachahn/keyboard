# My Keyboard

I have a Kinesis Advantage2. I like it a lot

(I actually have two of them, at work and at home, so I need to sync between
them.)


## Keyboard Shortcuts

* Enable "PUM" (Power User Mode) (Program + Shift + Esc)
  * Only need to do this once
* Open "Kinesis KB" v-drive (Program + F1)
  * PUM is required
* Unmount v-drive (Program + F1)


## How to remap a key

I always have a hard time figuring out what they mean by" source key" and
"destination key".

Let's say I want my Caps Lock button to actually be my left CTRL button. What do
I do?

Once getting into program remap mode, first press "left CTRL", then press
"caps lock".

This will add the line `[caps]>[lctrl]` to your config.

Note: Although your keyboard may be in MacOS mode, when remapping, your keys are
always in Windows mode.
